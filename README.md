# Real-Time License Plate Detection

A Python-based project for real-time license plate detection and character recognition using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This project implements an automated license plate recognition system that can:
- Detect license plates from video streams or images
- Segment individual characters from the detected plate
- Recognize the characters using a trained SVM model
- Output the complete license plate number

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- imutils
